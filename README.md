Sucker Punch is a single-process Ruby asynchronous processing library. It's [girl_friday](https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday)  and DSL sugar on top of [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/). With Celluloid's actor pattern, we can do asynchronous processing within a single process. This reduces costs of hosting on a service like Heroku along with the memory footprint of having to maintain additional jobs if hosting on a dedicated server. All queues can run within a single Rails/Sinatra process.

Sucker Punch is perfect for asynchronous processes like emailing, data crunching, or social platform manipulation. No reason to hold up a user when you can do these things in the background within the same process as your web application...

Sucker Punch is built on top of [Celluloid
Pools](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Pools). Each job is setup as
a pool, which equates to its own queue with individual workers working against
the jobs. Unlike most other background processing libraries, Sucker
Punch's jobs are stored in memory. The benefit to this is there is no
additional infrastructure requirement (ie. database, redis, etc.). The downside
is that if the web processes is restarted and there are jobs that haven't yet
been processed, they will be lost. For this reason, Sucker Punch is generally
recommended for jobs that are fast and non-mission critical (ie. logs, emails,
etc.).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sucker_punch', '~> 1.0'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sucker_punch

## Usage

Each job acts as its own queue and should be a separate Ruby class that:

* includes `SuckerPunch::Job`
* defines the instance method `perform` that includes the code the job will run when enqueued


```Ruby
# app/jobs/log_job.rb

class LogJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(event)
    Log.new(event).track
  end
end
```

Synchronous:

```Ruby
LogJob.new.perform("login")
```

Asynchronous:

```Ruby
LogJob.new.async.perform("login") # => nil
```

Jobs interacting with `ActiveRecord` should take special precaution not to exhaust connections in the pool. This can be done with `ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection`, which ensures the connection is returned back to the pool when completed.

```Ruby
# app/jobs/awesome_job.rb

class AwesomeJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(user_id)
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection do
      user = User.find(user_id)
      user.update_attributes(is_awesome: true)
    end
  end
end
```

We can create a job from within another job:

```Ruby
class AwesomeJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(user_id)
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection do
      user = User.find(user_id)
      user.update_attributes(is_awesome: true)
      LogJob.new.async.perform("User #{user.id} became awesome!")
    end
  end
end
```

The number of workers can be set from the Job using the `workers` method:

```Ruby
class LogJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job
  workers 4

  def perform(event)
    Log.new(event).track
  end
end
```

If the `workers` method is not set, the default is 1 per CUP core.

## Perform In

Many background processing libraries have methods to perform operations after a
certain amount of time. Fortunately, timers are built-in to Celluloid, so you
can take advantage of them with the `later` method:

``` ruby
class Job
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(data)
    puts data
  end

  def later(sec, data)
    after(sec) { perform(data) }
  end
end

Job.new.async.perform("asdf")
Job.new.async.later(60, "asdf") # `perform` will be excuted 60 sec. later
```

## Logger

```Ruby
SuckerPunch.logger = Logger.new('sucker_punch.log')
SuckerPunch.logger # => #<Logger:0x007fa1f28b83f0>
```

_Note: If Sucker Punch is being used within a Rails application, Sucker Punch's logger
is set to Rails.logger by default._

## Exceptions

You can customize how to handle uncaught exceptions that are raised by your jobs.

For example, using Rails and the ExceptionNotification gem, add a new initializer `config/initializers/sucker_punch.rb`:

```Ruby
SuckerPunch.exception_handler { |ex| ExceptionNotifier.notify_exception(ex) }
```

Or, using Airbrake:

```Ruby
SuckerPunch.exception_handler { |ex| Airbrake.notify(ex) }
```

Full job data can be reported like this:

```Ruby
def perform(all, my, arguments)
  ... your code ...
rescue Exception
  Airbrake.error($!, [self.class.name, all, my, arguments].inspect)
  raise
end
```

## Timeouts

Using `Timeout` causes persistent connections to [randomly get corrupted](http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/05/08/timeout-rubys-most-dangerous-api).
Do not use timeouts as control flow, use builtin connection timeouts.
If you decide to use Timeout, only use it as last resort to know something went very wrong and
ideally restart the worker process after every timeout.

## Testing

Requiring this library causes your jobs to run everything inline. So a call to the following will actually be SYNCHRONOUS:

```Ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'sucker_punch/testing/inline'
```

```Ruby
Log.new.async.perform("login") # => Will be synchronous and block until job is finished
```

## Rails

If you're using Sucker Punch with Rails, there's a built-in generator task:

```ruby
$ rails g sucker_punch:job logger
```

would create the file `app/jobs/logger_job.rb` with a unimplemented `#perform`
method.

## Active Job

Sucker Punch has been added as an Active Job adapter in Rails 4.2.
See the [guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) for
configuration and implementation.

Add Sucker Punch to your `Gemfile`:

```Ruby
gem 'sucker_punch'
```

And then configure the backend to use Sucker Punch:

```Ruby
# config/initializers/sucker_punch.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sucker_punch
end

```

## Troubleshooting

### Initializers for forking servers (Unicorn, Passenger, etc.)

Previously, Sucker Punch required an initializer and that posed problems for
Unicorn and Passenger and other servers that fork.  Version 1 was rewritten to
not require any special code to be executed after forking occurs. Please remove
 if you're using version `>= 1.0.0`

### Class naming

Job classes are ultimately Celluloid Actor classes. As a result, class names
are susceptible to being clobbered by Celluloid's internal classes.  To ensure
the intended application class is loaded, preface classes with `::`, or use
names like `NotificationsMailer` or `UserMailer`. Example:

```Ruby
class EmailJob
  include SuckerPunch::Job

  def perform(contact)
    @contact = contact
    ::Notifications.contact_form(@contact).deliver # => If you don't use :: in this case, the notifications class from Celluloid will be loaded
  end
end
```

### Cleaning test data transactions

If you're running tests in transactions (using Database Cleaner or a native solution), Sucker Punch jobs may have trouble finding database records that were created during test setup because the job class is running in a separate thread and the Transaction operates on a different thread so it clears out the data before the job can do its business. The best thing to do is cleanup data created for tests jobs through a truncation strategy by tagging the rspec tests as jobs and then specifying the strategy in `spec_helper` like below. And do not forget to turn off transactional fixtures (delete, comment or set it to `false`).

```Ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|

  # Turn off transactional fixtures (delete, comment or set it to `false`)
  # config.use_transactional_fixtures = true

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  end

  # Clean up all jobs specs with truncation
  config.before(:each, job: true) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end

  config.after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end
end

# spec/jobs/email_job_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'

# Tag the spec as a job spec so data is persisted long enough for the test
describe EmailJob, job: true do
  describe "#perform" do
    let(:user) { FactoryGirl.create(:user) }

    it "delivers an email" do
      expect {
        EmailJob.new.perform(user.id)
      }.to change{ ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.size }.by(1)
    end
  end
end
```

## Gem Name

...is awesome. But I can't take credit for it. Thanks to
[@jmazzi](https://twitter.com/jmazzi) for his superior naming skills. If you're
looking for a name for something, he is the one to go to.
