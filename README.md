Sucker Punch is a single-process Ruby asynchronous processing library. It's [girl_friday](https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday) with syntax from [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) and DSL sugar on top of [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/). With Celluloid's actor pattern, we can do asynchronous processing within a single process. This reduces costs of hosting on a service like Heroku along with the memory footprint of having to maintain additional workers if hosting on a dedicated server. All queues can run within a single Rails/Sinatra process.

Sucker Punch is perfect for asynchronous processes like emailing, data crunching, or social platform manipulation. No reason to hold up a user when you can do these things in the background within the same process as your web application...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sucker_punch'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sucker_punch

## Usage

Configuration:

`config/initializers/sucker_punch.rb`

```Ruby
  SuckerPunch.config do
    queue name: :log_queue, worker: LogWorker, size: 10
    queue name: :awesome_queue, worker: AwesomeWorker, size: 2
  end
```

Workers:

`app/workers/log_worker.rb`

```Ruby
class LogWorker
  include SuckerPunch::Worker

  def perform(event)
    Log.new(event).track
  end
end
```

All workers should define an instance method `perform`, of which the job being queued will adhere to.

Workers interacting with `ActiveRecord` should take special precaution not to exhaust connections in the pool. This can be done with `ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection`, which ensures the connection is returned back to the pool when completed.

`app/workers/awesome_worker.rb`

```Ruby
class AwesomeWorker
  include SuckerPunch::Worker

  def perform(user_id)
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection do
      user = User.find(user_id)
      user.update_attributes(is_awesome: true)
    end
  end
end
```

Queues:

```Ruby
SuckerPunch::Queue[:log_queue] # Just a wrapper for the LogWorker class
SuckerPunch::Queue.new(:log_queue)
```

Synchronous:

```Ruby
SuckerPunch::Queue[:log_queue].perform("login")
```

Asynchronous:

```Ruby
SuckerPunch::Queue[:log_queue].async.perform("login") # => nil
```

Stats:

```Ruby
SuckerPunch::Queue[:log_queue].size # => 7
SuckerPunch::Queue[:log_queue].busy_size # => 4
SuckerPunch::Queue[:log_queue].idle_size # => 3
```
